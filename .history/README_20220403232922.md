## Usage

Clone the repository, run 'npm i' to install dependencies and 'npm start' to run the server. Or use the deployed application on Heroku. Then you may choose to log in or register a new account, and search by title or keywords. You can then click to save any books that you wish. To see your saved books, click "see your books" in the navbar.

## Demonstration

## Challenges

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get this project working again after my commits. I have an Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', which I was told means that my front end and back end are not connecting, but I was unable to pinpoint the exact problem. Additionally, I have warnings for accessing non-existent properties in the terminal, and I'm not sure what's causing that. Feedback would be greatly appreciated.

## Contact
