## Challenges

The hardest parts of this assignment were getting a user's thoughts to be deleted when that user is deleted, and getting the friend and reaction counts to work appropriately. I still think there's room for improvement. For example, there's a few useless data fields that could probably be removed without consequence, and the pathing for the routes is a little convoluted with some redundancies, such as needing to specify the ID in both the path and the JSON body. Overall, I am happy with it, but it could definitely use some work to make it really streamlined.
